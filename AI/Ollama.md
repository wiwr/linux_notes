>>> how to write prompt for you?
To write a prompt for me, consider the following tips:

1. **Be clear and concise**: Clearly state what you want to know or 
accomplish. Avoid vague or open-ended questions.
2. **Use specific language**: Use specific words and phrases that 
accurately describe your topic or question.
3. **Provide context**: Give me some background information or context 
about your question or topic, if applicable.
4. **Ask a specific question**: Ask a specific question or request a response to a particular prompt.

Here are some examples of good prompts:

* "Write a short story about a character who discovers a hidden world."
* "Explain the concept of artificial intelligence in simple terms."
* "Generate a list of 5 potential names for a new business startup."
* "Summarize the main points of the article 'The Impact of Climate Change on Global Food Systems'."
* "Create a conversation between two historical figures."

On the other hand, here are some examples of poor prompts:

* "Tell me something interesting."
* "What's the meaning of life?"
* "Write a poem about my feelings."
* "Explain everything about quantum mechanics in one sentence."

Avoid using phrases like "Just answer this" or "Make it true," as they can be too broad or ambiguous. Instead, try to provide more context and specificity.

If you're still unsure, feel free to ask me for clarification or help with your prompt!
